import random    
# Number guessing game
# --------------------

# Implement the following game in python:

# 1. Randomly select a number between 1 and 20 | 50 | 100

#     import random                   <-- needs to go at the top of your python file

#     print random.randint(1,101)     <-- prints random number between 1 and 100

# 2. Ask the user to make a guess
#     Look at the input() function - e.g:
#         guess = input("Make a guess: ")

# 3. If correct report total number of guesses

# 4. Otherwise, report higher or lower than target number.

# Testing?
#     What kind of tests, if any, do you feel would be necessary/appropriate 
#     for your code?
randomnumber =  (random.randint(1,101))

chance = 0
status="play"

while (status=="play"):
    guess = input("Make a guess: ")
    if(randomnumber==guess):
        print("You win! The number was "+randomnumber)
        status="quit"
    else:
        chance+=1
        if (int(randomnumber)<int(guess)):
                print("Random number is lower than"+guess)
        else:
                print("Random number is higher than"+guess)
